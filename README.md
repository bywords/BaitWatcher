# BaitWatcher

This repository includes the implementation details of BaitWatcher, a lightweight web interface that guides readers to know the likelihood of the incongruence in news articles before clicking the headlines.

A research paper on BaitWatcher will be appeared as one of the book chapters on Fake News, Disinformation, and Misinformation in Social Media (FNDM), published by Springer.
This study was extended from the previous paper published at AAAI'19. [[paper]](https://wvvw.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3756/3634) [[github]](https://github.com/david-yoon/detecting-incongruity)
